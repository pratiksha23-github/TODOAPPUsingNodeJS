# MyToDoApp

### This is Coding Ninja's Assignment (Major Project - 1) in which I made a TODO List app

- In this app, users can create to-do lists, where they can add list of Tasks.
- The Task created by user then should be stored in the Database.
- Under each list, you can add "Cards," which are items in a list.
- You can add a due date, a checklist and labels to each card.
